# Atom Shell Cookies

Adds support for cookies in Atom Shell. Cookies are persisted through localStorage.

## Usage

In your app's `renderer` code, just require this package:

```js
require('atom-shell-cookies')
```

## Contributing

Original code is written in `index.coffee`. Write code in coffeescript, and run `guard` to compile coffeescript on the fly.
